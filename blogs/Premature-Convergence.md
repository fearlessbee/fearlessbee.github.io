This is a concept in ml trainning. I think it can be also used in life.


Recall the study and learning experience in college, I find that LR([learning rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_rate)) dropped fastly. 

I remembered the thoughts I had:
1. I like my major.
2. I need to foucs on everything about it.
3. I should learn more in depth.

It was like my whole world. That's good and I can't judge it as a wrong thing from my current perspective. It helps me to find jobs and get good salary and I appreciate.

However, for ml models, optimum are important. And for humans, we want to know how we can get better or even best in our life.
