<h1>Premature Convergence</h1>
<h2>2025-08-02</h2>
<p>This is a concept in ml trainning. I think it can be also used in life.</p>
<p>Recall the study and learning experience in college, I find that LR(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_rate">learning rate</a>) dropped fastly. </p>
<p>I remembered the thoughts I had:</p>
<ol>
<li>I like my major.</li>
<li>I need to foucs on everything about it.</li>
<li>I should learn more in depth.</li>
</ol>
<p>It was like my whole world. That&#39;s good and I can&#39;t judge it as a wrong thing from my current perspective. It helps me to find jobs and get good salary and I appreciate.</p>
<p>However, for ml models, optimum are important. And for humans, we want to know how we can get better or even best in our life.</p>
